# Text-Summarization
Utilizing spaCy's en_core_web_sm model, this project performs extractive text summarization through tokenization, POS tagging, and frequency analysis, condensing content while retaining key points.

This project implements extractive text summarization using spaCy, specifically leveraging the en_core_web_sm model. It utilizes tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization for preprocessing. Frequency analysis and sentence scoring based on normalized word frequencies are employed to generate extractive summaries. This approach condenses text while preserving its main points, providing a valuable tool for efficient content summarization.
